Project Proposal: [Breakout]

Team Members: [Christopher Anaya, Dyllan Kintner]
Client: [Christopher Anaya, Dyllan Kintner]
Date: [nov/14/24]

App Idea: [Our app idea is to enhance the classic Breakout game by making it level-based, where every 3 levels the ball speeds up slightly, and every 5 levels the bricks require 2 hits instead of 1. We also plan to add power-ups like freezing the ball, doubling the ball, speeding it up, and slowing it down, while allowing players to control the paddle's position by clicking anywhere on the screen to place it at the bottom.]

Target Audience: [This game is aimed at players aged 10 to 60+ who enjoy fun, level-based gameplay and want to see how far they can go without the game ending.]

Goals and Vision: [The goal is to transform the classic Breakout game into a level-based experience, gradually increasing the difficulty as players progress.]

Key Features: [Single-player: mode with multipls levels,Score Tracking: Keep track of your highest level reached and challenge yourself to beat your own score, Dynamic Ball Speed: Every 3 levels, the ball speeds up slightly, increasing the challenge and excitement. Brick Hit Complexity: After every 5 levels, bricks require 2 hits to break instead of 1, adding strategic depth.Interactive Paddle Control: Use click-to-position controls to place the paddle anywhere along the bottom of the screen, allowing for more precise movement and strategy.]

Success Criteria: [The game will be considered successful if it is free of major bugs, enjoyable for the target audience, provides a progressively challenging experience, and encourages replayability, with positive feedback from players, high retention rates, and players achieving a sense of accomplishment as they advance through levels]

Technical Requirements: [The game will be developed for PC, running smoothly at 60 FPS, with mouse controls for paddle positioning. Levels will dynamically increase in difficulty with faster ball speeds every 3 levels and double-hit bricks every 5 levels. Power-ups like freezing or doubling the ball will add variety, and score tracking will save the highest level reached. Background music and sound effects will enhance gameplay, with testing focused on ensuring a bug-free experience.]
