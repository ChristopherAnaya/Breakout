## Game Overview
 The goal of the game is to beat as many levels as possible as they increase in difficulty. You destroy blocks using a ball that bounces off the player charter below. every three levels it gets faster and every five levels it takes one more hit per block. The user also has access to powerups to help them such as frezzing, slowdown, double size etc.

## Functional Requirements
 **Core Features**
    
 The game must be able to generate new levels for as long as possible and keep track of the increasing difficulty. It must also be able to accurately track the player's movement. It must also be able to randomly generate power ups after a block is destroyed.

 **User Interactions** 

 The player will interact by clicking where they want their bar to be. It can be anywhere left to right but will stay on the same y access

## Non-Functional Requirements
 **Usability**

 The first level will be pretty easy and since the user only needs to click with  a mouse they should be able to easily figure out how to use the controls

 **Performance**
 
 The game is single player and uses very few resources. It will likely be able to handle high frame rates.

 **Cross-Platform Compatibility**

 The games will work on pc and mobile because it only uses tap/click controls.

## Design Requirements
 **Graphics and Visuals** 

 The game will have a similar look to its original arcade style

 **Audio**

 The game will feature simple audio cues for beating a level, getting a power up, and destroying a block.

## Data Requirements
 The level the user has made it to and the speed and difficulty of the game will need to be tracked and will be saved on the user's local computer.

## Collaboration with Client
 Since the game is being designed by us there is no need for more surveys or meetings. We will just make sure that both of us stay on task periodically checking in.
